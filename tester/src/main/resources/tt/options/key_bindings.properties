# Key bindings (accelerators) for GUI elements. When pressed, the action
# associated with that element will be invoked.
#
# Key bindings can be almost anything, but they are not allowed conflict:
#   - with each other 
#   - with ALT mnemonics (see mnemonics.properties) 
#   - with default text box inputs (ctrl c, ctrl a, ctrl v, etc.)
#
# Key bindings can be defined as keys with or without modifiers:
#   - available modifiers: ctrl, shift, alt, meta, altGraph
#   - special keys: ENTER, INSERT, DELETE, HOME, etc. 
#
# Full definition: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html#getKeyStroke(java.lang.String)
#
# Key bindings can be left empty, in which case they are ignored.
