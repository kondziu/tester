Tester v2.2
===========

A vocab testing program I wrote in my student days that people still apparently find useful.

Running
-------

Make sure you have **Java** installed, then run **./start-ubu.sh** or maybe you
can go into exercises and click on **tester.jar** too. I dunno it's been a
while.

Source code
-----------

The source code is in **exercises/tester-2.2.zip**.
